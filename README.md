# GM3cpp
Part of Guava implementation of Murmurhash3 algorithm rewritten in C++. Only String hashing functions are included.  

Provided implementation doesn't provide the same results as reference code     
(https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/blob/master/src/MurmurHash3.cpp), nonetheless identical to Guava ones.    
Each hashing function from Guava implementation uses internal buffer. 

This library has been created for MHAP C++ implementation tests and bencharks: https://github.com/formateu/MHAP.
